            <h2 >Purpose of the site</h2>
            <p> 
                The idea to create this site came on a cozy autumn evening. I cooked cocoa, took a blanket and began to look for a series for viewing.
                Unfortunately, the popular trackers of serials had many shortcomings,
                from the copied description of the series and ending with a lot of obtrusive advertising. I wanted to create something of my own.
                What will be really <strong>convenient and practical</strong>. On the site you can not just choose a good series,
                but also read the <strong>author's materials</strong> about each of the series available on the site. <strong>So, enjoy)</strong>

                    This part of the text is for the most fearless. Here I will tell about myself.<br>
                    My name is <b>Dima</b>. Age 18+;).
                    I study at the <a href="http://kpi.ua/">KPI named after Igor Sikorsky</a>

                    I'm interested in serials since childhood. Perhaps this is all the information I leave here.<br><br>
